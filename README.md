# AzerothCore modified for 5 man raids

## Raid Changes

Health and Damage values were readjusted for all raids
Specific values can be seen in the mod_quickbalance_* tables.

The 25man version of raids can be seen as "challenge modes".

### Naxxramas

#### Anub'Rekhan
* Reduced movement speed of Anub'Rekhan during Locust Swarm by 80% instead of 40%. This way the tank should still be able to pick up Crypt Guard adds

#### Thaddius
* Reduced damage of Feugen and Stalagg _severely_ to accommodate only 1 healer.

#### Sapphiron
* Only cast 1 life drain in 10 man mode (instead of 2)
* Only casts ice bolt on one person
* Ice bolt does not target lowest threat target

#### Gluth
* Disabled Mortal Wound
* Zombie movement speed reduced by 70%

#### Maexxna
* Web Wrap will not target lowest threat target (usually the healer)

### Vault of Archavon

##### Archavon

* Disabled Impale

### Icecrown Citadel

#### Stinky / Precious

* Disabled Mortal Wound

#### Festergut

*  Disabled Gastric Bloat
